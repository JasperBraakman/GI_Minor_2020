# Step 1: We first need to identify stations that are in close proximity to the locations of our car data sample.
# Remove the hastag below
# all_stations=[{'number':'NL49007'},{'number':'NL10641'}]

# Step 2: Now create an average score of all the measurements for both compounds for both stations and add this score to the df. 
# This step is simular to what we did in "timeseries.py" refer back to that code for help.
# Hint: you can either write the code four times, for each station and compound seperate or you can use
# a loop embedded in a loop. One to loop over the stations and one to loop over te compounds.

# Step 3: Transport the df into a CSV file
