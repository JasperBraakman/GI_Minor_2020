# In order to understand how the luchtmeetnet API works, we are first going to create a list of all available stations. 
# Go to https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1562017/RVnbBxf9 and search for the suitable URL and request the data using requests.


# In order to access the various data nodes we are going to create a python dictionary from the response by reading the json API output. 



# Now explore the response using the variable explorer of Spyder or by printing it out to console.
# Save the first location to a variable and print it out the the console.




# Find a station that is within Amsterdam (or any other city you prefer).
# Save location name and station number to variables
# and print out to console




# Request the data of your chosen station and create a python dictionary
# Hint: you need to specify the station number in the URL. In order to see how that is done please check the API documentation for an example.
# Now use the variable for the station number created just before.




# Save the description, the chemical compounds which are measured at this
# station and the location (coordinates) to variables and print the result.
